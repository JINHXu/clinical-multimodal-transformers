Risks\\n explained included stroke, loss of vision and speech, temporary or permanent,\\n with possible treatment with stent and coils if needed. \\n\\n The patient was brought to the Interventional Neuroradiology Theater and\\n placed on the biplane table in supine position.  Both groins were prepped and\\n draped in the usual sterile fashion.  Access to the right common femoral\\n artery was obtained using a 19 gauge single wall needle, under local\\n anesthesia using 1% lidocaine mixed with sodium bicarbonate and with aseptic\\n precautions.  Through the needle, a 0.35 [**Last Name (un) 52**] wire was introduced and the\\n needle taken out.  Over the wire, a 5 French vascular sheath was placed and\\n connected to a saline infusion (mixed with heparin 500 units in 500 cc of\\n saline) with a continuous drip.  Through the sheath, a 4 French Berenstein\\n catheter was introduced and connected to continuous saline infusion (with\\n mixture of 1000 units of heparin in 1000 cc of saline). \\n\\n The following blood vessels were selectively catheterized and arteriograms\\n were performed from right internal carotid artery, left internal carotid\\n artery and left vertebral artery. \\n\\n RIGHT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:\\n\\n Evaluation of the right internal carotid artery demonstrates good flow in the\\n distal right internal carotid artery, anterior and middle cerebral arteries. \\n\\n LEFT INTERNAL CAROTID ARTERY:\\n\\n                                                             (Over)\\n\\n [**2174-1-29**] 11:18 AM\\n CAROT/CEREB [**Hospital1 **]                                                  Clip # [**Clip Number (Radiology) 60218**]\\n Reason: angiogram for assessment and coiling of Left PCOMM aneurysm\\n Admitting Diagnosis: SUBARACHNOID HEMORRHAGE\\n  Contrast: OMNIPAQUE Amt: 310\\n ______________________________________________________________________________\\n                                 FINAL REPORT\\n (Cont)\\n Evaluation of the left internal carotid artery demonstrates good flow in the\\n distal left internal carotid artery, anterior and middle cerebral arteries. \\n There is a 6 x 7 mm supraclinoid aneurysm arising medially and superiorly and\\n orienting superiorly.

He\\nwas started on  zosyn, ciprofloxacin, and vancomycin and\\ncompleted an 8 day course of treatment for HAP, completed on\\n[**2126-8-5**].  He underwent diagnostic thoracentesis on [**2126-7-31**] of the\\nright pleural effusion and then chest tube was placed to\\nsuction.  The patient experienced an hypoxic episode 2 hours\\nafter chest tube placement, two CXRs confirmed correct tube\\nplacement and the absence of a pneumothorax. The patient\\nstabilized after NT suction.  Effusion was noted to be exudative\\nfrom CHF.  In the mean time, echocardiogram was obtained showing\\nmoderate to severe heart failure and aggressive medical\\nmanagement of heart failure was recommended.  Pt was\\naggressively diuresed which improved hypoxia, but no improvement\\nin chest tube output.  He began to develop difficulty with thick\\nsecretions on [**2126-8-7**] for which regimen frequent suctioning,\\nchest PT, and deep suctioning was started.  Chest tube remained\\nin place draining 100-300cc daily until decided to d/c chest\\ntube on [**2126-8-9**] to avoid further complication. \\n. \\nOn [**2126-8-9**] Mr. [**Known lastname 36803**] became unresponsive, hypoxic, and\\nhypotensive, and a code blue was called. He was intubated and\\ntransferred to the ICU. He required intermittent pressors for\\nseveral days thought to be secondary to sepsis.  Pneumonia vs.\\naspiration were thought to be the cause of his respiratory\\nfailure, and he was started on Tobramycin/Vancomycin/Zosyn for\\ncoverage of his known bugs and empirically.  He was also\\ndiuresed aggressively.  The MICU team noted difficulty weaning\\nthe vent secondary to secretions.  On [**2126-8-15**] he self-extubated,\\nwas transitioned from a bag mask (immediately after extubation)\\nto a NRB and was weaned to a face mask. He tolerated the\\nextubation and change to face mask well.  He was transferred to\\nthe floor on [**8-16**]. \\n. \\nOn the medical floor, he developed intermittent hyoxia with O2\\nsats dropping to the mid 70s on RA/ 80s on face mask. Pt had a\\ndifficult time keeping the face mask and nasal cannula due to\\nworsening delirium.  Hypoxic episodes were believed to be due to\\nmucus plugging and patient has a weak cough.  Pt was thought to\\nbe clinically dry on exam, with metabolic alkylosis.  He\\ncontinued to have frequent plugging and had an episode of\\ndesaturation to 50% which resolved with nasotracheal suctioning. \\nPt was started on a more aggressive regimen of deep and\\nsuperficial suctioning, nebulizers, humidified air.  Was unable\\nto tolerate chest PT on the floor due to desaturation with\\nposition changes and hip pain. Most recent CXR shows bilateral\\npulmonary effusion, pulmonary edema, but without any acute\\nchange from baseline. Pt was tranferred back to MICU on [**8-19**] due\\nto high nursing needs and closer monitoring.  At time of tranfer\\nhe was satting 92% on 5L NC\\n. \\n#Anemia: Pt was noted to have a hematocrit of 20 on admission\\nwith guiac positive stools from 30 at time of discharge.  He was\\nremained on a heparin gtt while evaluated for GIB.  EGD and\\ncolonoscopy performed [**2126-8-5**] showed diverticulosis, but no sign\\nof active bleed.  His hematocrit continued to decline very lowly\\nthought to be from a very slow GIB in the setting of\\nanticoagulation and poor marrow response.  Stool guiac\\ndocumented negative [**8-16**], and brown stools.  Hematocrit remained\\nsubsequently stable until [**8-17**].  At that time his hematocrit\\ndropped from 25 --> 23 --> 18 and he was transfused 3 units on\\n[**8-18**] with a 7 point increase in Hct.  Concerning sources of\\nbleed include oropharyngeal blood loss, pt has been noted to\\nhave hemoptysis (thought to be [**1-30**] to trauma from nasopharyngeal\\nsuctioning) and nurses have been suctioning up to 50 cc blood\\nsince AM of [**8-19**].  He needs, stools (guiac <neagative [**8-19**]),\\nhemolytic anemia associated with transfusion (though coombs test\\nnegative), hemothroax (CXR stable with bilat effusions), or\\npossibly a hematoma in the left hip as he reports pain in this\\narea since [**8-17**] and there is increased emema of the L hip\\ncompared to the right.  Imaging of the hip has been delayed due\\nto concern over the patient's respiratory status. \\n. \\n#Leukocytosis:\\nOn [**2126-8-19**], pt was noted to develop a leukocytosis to 21.  At\\nthe time he was already on broad spectrum antibiotics with\\nVancomycin, Zosyn, and Tobramycin for MDR psuedomonas and MRSA\\npneumonia.  Repeat CXR showed no new consolidation, UA and Stool\\nculture for Cdiff were sent.  (UA not obtained as of yet)\\n. \\n# History of DVT/PE:  Pt remained on anticoagulation throughout\\nhis hospitalization in various forms, always bridged when\\nsubtherapeutic.  At the time of transfer, coumadin was held,\\nconcern for .  MICU may decide to resume. \\n.\\n#Psych - The patient experienced multiple episode of\\nconfusion/agitation. These episodes occured more often during\\nthe evening hours. The etiology is likely multifactorial. \\nCitalopram and quetiapine at home doses were continued during\\nthe admission.  Later in his hospitalization he was found to\\nhave waxing and [**Doctor Last Name 688**] orientation and he was started on 0.5mg\\nhaldol [**Hospital1 **], as his delirium was an impairment to keeping his\\noxygen delivery devices to his face. \\n.\\n#Atrial fibrilation - The patient had multiple episodes of\\natrial fibrillation with RVR with rates in the 130s that were\\ncontrolled with diltiazem. Otherwise the patient was treated\\nwith home doses of digoxin and sotolol, with good heart rate\\ncontrol. In the ICU his nodal agents were held due to\\nhypotension but they were uptitrated to home doses when he\\nreturned to the flor.  He was noted to have worsening afib with\\nRVR when volume depleted on [**8-17**] which improved with\\ndiscontinuation of lasix. \\n.\\n# CAD - Pt was noted to have new wall motion abnormalities on a\\npoor quality echocardiogram.  However, this was highly\\nsuggestive of a relatively recent episode of ACS.  Pt had no\\nchest pain during admission, and EKG remained stable through\\nout.  ASA was held initially in the setting of acute bleeding\\nrisk, but was resumed after HCT stabilized.  His statin dose was\\nincreased. \\n.\\n#Hypothyroidism - TSH: 8.5, Free T4 1.1. Patient was never\\nsymptomatic. Synthroid was continued at the patient's home dose. \\n\\n. \\n#Goals of care - Pt was Full code at the start of this admission\\nwhich was confirmed on the day of his respiratory code [**8-9**].  On\\n[**8-16**], code status was readdressed, pt was less confident of his\\ndecision but decided to remain full code.  On [**8-17**] after pt was\\ntriggered for afib with RVR and hypoxia, code status was\\nreaddressed and pt stated he would not want to be intubated or\\nresuscitated or go back to the ICU.  This was confirmed on [**8-19**]\\nagain after trigger for hypoxia to 50% due to secretions. \\nUnfortunately, due to high monitoring, suctioning, and other\\nmedical needs, patient was unable to be managed on the floor. \\nHe was in agreement with ICU tranfer for this reason. In the\\nICU, it was noted that he had bloodly secretions, presumably\\nfrom nasopharyngeal trauma of agressive suctioning. The famiyl\\nwas updated, and confirmed the DNR/DNI goals of care. \\nUnfortunately, the morning of [**2126-8-20**], he became acutely\\nbradycardic to the 20s and unresponsive. There was a faint\\nfemoral pulse. A few minutes later, the patient became\\npulseless. He was pronounced dead at 0715 that morning.

Toxic/metabolic source from UTI appears\\nmost likely.  In setting of recent ICH, CT head was pursued and\\nrevealed no structural abnormality or bleed.  Electrolytes are\\notherwise within normal limits.  No seizure activity noted.  ACS\\npossible given risk factors, though troponins negative. \\nHypercarbia likewise possible, but his pCO2 seems to be better\\nthan reference levels at the time of his last discharge. \\nAntihistamines provided in treatment of his rash can also\\ncontribute to his AMS. Urine tox screen was negative. AMS likely\\ndue to urosepsis. \\n.\\n# HYPOTENSION:  Patient presented with BP 80/40s from rehab,\\nalso of unclear etiology though it was fluid-responsive in the\\nED to 2LNS to sbb>100.  Urosepsis is possible given his\\nconcerning UA and leukocytosis- no other infectious sources seen\\nin the lung, however abdominal CT makes note of a soft tissue\\ndensity c/w neoplasm versus diverticulitis.  PE and dissection\\nruled out with CTA due to hypoxia and hypotension.  Started on\\nciprofloxacin which will need to continue for total 14 days. \\nHolding atenolol until BP normalizes. \\n.\\n# URINARY TRACT INFECTION:  UA revealing likely UTI.  Had recent\\nUTI in his last hospitalization growing a relatively\\n[**Name2 (NI) **]-sensitive proteus and enterococcus.  Will narrow his\\nantibiotic spectrum to ciprofloxacin based on his previous\\nsensitivities. Blood and urine cultures need to be followed. \\n.\\n# RASH:  Blanching, confluent maculopapular rash over the back\\nand extensor surfaces of the upper arms and legs.  Appears\\nconsistent with drug rash, though he has no peripheral\\neosinophilia, and he was not recently challenged with new drugs. \\nA viral exanthem is also possible.  Fungal/candidal infection\\nappears unlikely. Rash is improving and should be followed by\\nPCP. [**Name10 (NameIs) **] mucosal involvment. \\n.\\n# ABDOMINAL SOFT TISSUE DENSITY: Seen on CT abdomen, of unclear\\netiology: neoplasm versus possible small bowel diverticulitis. \\nWill need repeat CT in three weeks\\n\\n# RECENT INTRACRANIAL HEMORRHAGE:  He recently underwent\\nhemorrhagic stroke possibly from converted ischemic stroke\\nversus amyloid process.  His neurologic exam is considerably\\nimproved compared to his discharge exam.  No further bleed seen\\non admission CT Head.  Continue keppra for seizure prophylaxis. \\n.\\n# CHRONIC OBSTRUCTIVE PULMONARY DISEASE:  CTA makes note of\\nstable emphysema. He has a substantial baseline 02 requirement\\nof 3.5LNC, so he is likewise at his respiratory baseline. \\nExacerbation appears unlikely.  Continue albuterol and\\nipratropium nebs as needed\\n. \\n# DIASTOLIC DYSFUNCTION: he carries a diagnosis of CHF,  though\\nEF shown to be preserved at 50-55% per previous hospitalization. \\nAppears dry on exam\\n. \\n# HYPERTENSION: holding amlodipine and atenolol in the setting\\nof hypotension. \\n.\\n\\nPt admitted [**4-25**] with hypotension and responsive to 2L NS with\\nSBP in low 100's. NCHCT showed no acute process (final read.) CT\\ntorso concering for possible malignancy. He will require\\ninterval CT in three weeks. Read posted below. \\n-CT Torso final read: 1. No acute process of the chest. \\n2. Soft tissue lesion in the mesentery of the right mid abdomen\\nwith\\nsurrounding inflammation of the mesenteric fat is new compared\\nto [**2173-3-5**]. Differential diagnosis is broad and\\nincludes carcinoid, or less likely atypical Meckel\\ndiverticulitis, sclerosing mesenteritis, or or other neoplasms\\n(metastases, soft tissue sarcoma or lymphoma). \\nHe was started on [**Year (4 digits) 9847**] for his likely urinary source and will\\ncontinue this regime pending cultures. Attempted to load with\\nphenytoin but pt did not tolerate [**2-24**] caustic infusion and\\nhypotension. Per Neuro and Pharmacy, Keppra unlikely to cause\\ndrug rash that was present upon presentation, and given Dilantin\\nintolerance, started Keppra back. He was alos Guaiac negative. \\nHypotension likely result of urosepsis and caused altered mental\\nstatus. At dischare pt with SBP>100 and at normal mentation. \\nUnclear source of rash, but it is resolving.

She was mentating beautifully\\ndespite BP in the 80-90\\'s, with two peripheral IV\\'s, 1 of which\\nwas running the heparin gtt for her ACS and the other running\\nthe remaining IVF which had been ordered for her on the floor. \\nInitially she seemed to be responding to the IVF, with her\\npressures up into the high 80\\'s-90\\'s.  While getting the ICU\\nconsent, she refused several things on the consent form\\nincluding A-lines, LP, etc.  There was a fairly involved\\ndiscussion about central lines because there was a high\\nliklihood that she might need one, and she did agree to one if\\nnecessary.  Her pressures/MAPS did not improve and the RN\\'s\\ncouldn\\'t get any further PIV\\'s.  Her mentation remained\\nexcellent but there was some concern as her BP wasn\\'t\\nstabilizing, and we also needed more access for IV antibiotics. \\nThe RN\\'s also discovered that her ostomy appeared very strange\\nwhen they removed her ostomy appliance - it didn\\'t look like a\\nnormal round, ostomy - it appeared sunken, more like a natural\\nfistula than a surgically created ostomy. \\n\\nHer abdominal exam was somewhat tender to palpation but no\\nrebound or guarding. \\nThe MICU attending was called and there were multiple failed\\nattempts at placing a central line. The patient\\'s BP dwindled\\nafter the fluid was completed and did not respond to another\\nbolus, staying in the low eighties and then dropping further to\\nthe seventies.  Patient was started on periheral dopamine to\\nsupport her blood pressure.  Her mental status began to\\ndeteriorate and We (Attending, primary RN, other RNs, and\\nresident) stopped and discussed the overall situation.  We had\\nfailed to get any central access and the patient was requiring a\\nsupratherapeutic dose of peripheral dopamine to maintain any\\nkind of BP/MAP.   Her stat labs had come back and were overall\\nworse with notable ARF.  We discussed whether there was any\\nutility in calling a surgery consult.  During the initial\\ninterview, the patient had made it clear that she did not want\\nany aggressive interventions and was very specific about not\\nwanting any further surgeries.  Given her HD instability, active\\nACS, her ARF, and previously stated wishes, the attending spoke\\nto the patient, who was sleepy but mentating to some degree,\\nexplaining that she was extremely ill, and that we were going to\\nstop all invasive aggressive procedures and try to treat her\\nwith IV antibiotics.   The patient agreed.  Her son was\\n[**Name (NI) 653**] and it was explained that his mother had multiple\\nsystem failure and that all interventions except medications had\\nbeen stopped. \\n\\nIV antibiotics were started.  Her BP remained low but stable on\\nperipheral dopa.  She remained rousable for a while, but\\neventually become somnolent.  She went into V tach, then V fib,\\nand became asystolic.  She was pronounced dead at 2:17 AM.  The\\nfamily declined an autopsy. \\n\\n\\n\\nMedications on Admission:\\nPrilosec 20mg daily\\nSandostatin 100mcg SC TID\\nMag Oxide 500mg PO BID\\nDigoxin 0.125mg PO daily\\nCaptopril 6.25mg PO TID\\nLasix 20mg PO daily\\nNystatin S&S\\nToprol XL 100mg PO daily\\nMaalox prn\\nTylenol prn\\nPercocet prn\\n\\n\\nDischarge Medications:\\nexpired\\n\\nDischarge Disposition:\\nExpired\\n\\nDischarge Diagnosis:\\nexpired\\n\\nDischarge Condition:\\nexpired\\n\\nDischarge Instructions:\\nexpired\\n\\nFollowup Instructions:\\nexpired\\n\\n\\n']\n",
